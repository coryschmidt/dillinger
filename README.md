Down the Mark
=========

Down the Mark is an online Markdown editor based on Dillinger, created by Joe McCann. It supports saving and editing TXT and MD files from Dropbox and Github. Support for Box.net, Google Drive, and Evernote is coming.

[Markdown] the markup language was created by [John Gruber] and is intended as an inline, lightweight markup syntax that doesn't get in the way of the actual text.

## Acknowledgements
