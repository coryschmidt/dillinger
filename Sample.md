## Markdown Sample

Markdown allows you to add specific characters to your text to add formatting like:

- Bullets

1. Numbered
2. Lists

__Bold text__

*Italics*

	foreach( code_sample in codeSamples )
	{
       	PrependTabOrFourSpaces( code_sample );
	}  

Call out `CodeBlocks()` in the middle of a sentence with back ticks!

> And it's a piece of cake to  
> add block quotes. If you want  
> to end a line just add two or  
> more spaces to the end.
